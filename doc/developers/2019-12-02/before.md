# Goals achieved @ 2019-12-01 19:00 PM

- [x] correct steps to run
- [x] Python version documented
- [ ] (only minimally) code documentation
- [x] Robustness, logging, top-level processing of exceptions (project-space vs library exceptions)
- [x] Logging
- [x] user documentation
- [x] top-level config file
- [x] script that runs the whole process (for users)

# In preparation for talking about it

- The main, default entry point for running it is `bin/flist.py` without arguments. Accepts `--workspace`.
- The main, default entry point for configuration is `config.yaml`
- The main entry point for web documentation is https://github.com/simlei/org.cryptool.functionlist/
- Check out ${workspace}/html after a full run :)

- documentation of the code is lacking due to not getting everything quite done in the allotted time
