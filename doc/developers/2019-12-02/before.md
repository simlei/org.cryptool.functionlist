# Goals achieved @ 2019-12-01 19:00 PM

a) [x] correct steps to run
b) [x] Python version documented
c) [ ] (only minimally) code documentation
d) [x] Robustness, logging, top-level processing of exceptions (project-space vs library exceptions)
e) [x] Logging
f) [x] user documentation
g) [x] top-level config file
h) [x] script that runs the whole process (for users)

# In preparation for talking about it

- For checking the implementation parts, follow the instructions in the main `README`, and the linked user documentation
- The main, default entry point for running it is `bin/flist.py` without arguments. Accepts `--workspace`.
- The main, default entry point for configuration is `config.yaml`
- Check out ${workspace}/html after a full run :)

- documentation of the code is lacking due to not getting everything quite done in the allotted time
