- html generation was a good idea
- adding new steps is not ideal; needs adaptions in config.py, config.yaml and quite some boilerplate. Would generalization not be better?
- feels good to have something to look at, pipeline works good
- implementing hashing ids for CT2 surprisingly easy.

// good day
