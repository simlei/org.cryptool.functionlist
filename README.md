# CrypTool Function List

Aim of this project is to generate the data that feed into the [dynamic table of cryptological functions of the CrypTool project](https://www.cryptool.org/en/ctp-documentation/functionvolume).
To that end, it processes legacy files from, and data that is dynamically generated by:

 - [CrypTool 1](https://www.cryptool.org/en/cryptool1)
 - [CrypTool 2](https://www.cryptool.org/en/cryptool2)
 - [CrypTool Online](https://www.cryptool.org/en/cryptool-online)
 - [JCrypTool](https://www.cryptool.org/en/jcryptool)

The complete program with default behavior is started by running `bin/flist` with no arguments. The output will be the files in `ws` which is the default "workspace" of the program. This directory is created fresh with every start of `flist`, older versions are deleted. 

Learn how to set set another workspace path, and other configuration:

- `bin/flist --help`
- [User Documentation](doc/)

<!-- TODO: Exemplary output of the current revision can be seen in [doc_misc/newest_ws](doc_misc/newest_ws), which is a copy of the workspace of `bin/flist` after it has run, and an additional `bin/analyze` afterwards, on the same workspace. -->
